<p>What the world needs now is….more sustainable aircrafts.</p>
<p>When designing the interior of a sustainable aircraft you need to optimize the use of available space, minimize the weight and improve the comfort.
Prof. dr. Peter Vink from the TU Delft is a Professor of Environmental Ergonomics and worked on the aircraft interior of the Flying-V, an innovative flight concept which embraces an entirely different approach to aircraft design. He is going to tell us about their innovative ideas on improving passenger comfort.</p>

<p>Ps. This talk will be in English</p>

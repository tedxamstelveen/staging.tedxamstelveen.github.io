Prof. dr. Peter Vink from the TU Delft is a Professor of Environmental Ergonomics and worked on the aircraft interior of the Flying-V, an innovative flight concept which embraces an entirely different approach to aircraft design. He is going to tell us about their innovative ideas on improving passenger comfort.</p>
